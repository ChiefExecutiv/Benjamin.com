I am a big believer in agriculture as a foundation on which a first world Uganda will be built. 
If there's one thing that we should be good at, it should be farming, Uganda does have massive potential in it. 
Uganda can feed a total of 200 million people, so it can quite literally feed a continent.

Technically speaking, agriculture is the dominant sector in Uganda's economy, 
**68% of Uganda’s working population is employed in agriculture**. 
In FY 2021/22, agriculture accounted for about 24.1% of GDP and contributed 33% of export earnings.

Yet despite all this, Uganda's agricultural performance can be defined as lackluster at best. National agricultural output has grown at only 2% per annum over the last five years, compared to agricultural output growth of 3 to 5% in other EAC members and 3.3% per annum growth in Uganda’s population over the same period.

Ugandan agriculture has been negative for the last two decades. This suggests that on balance the country is now getting less for equal 
or greater effort.

### Why the poor performance
To begin with, Uganda farms like it's the 19th century. Centuries old farming methods and use of 'simple' tools affect overall output. Agricultural productivity in Uganda is below its potential – constrained by **limited use of modern farming methods**
We need to move on from hand hoes.

Poor inputs, poor storage methods are all responsible for the terrible quality of Ugandan agricultural output. A case study is Uganda's maize crisis, where Kenya placed a ban on Uganda's maize because "quote here". This raises questions on Uganda's product quality.

Climate change coupled with the use of poor farming methods. Global climate is changing, and not for the better. Reliance on seasonal rainfall, which is becoming more and more unpredictable affects planning, and causes seasonal fluctuations in output. Weather is increasingly volatile, yet few farmers use irrigation.

### What can be done about it
Capital investment is vital. Increase the amount of machinery that goes into agricultural production, this can increase yield exponentially and expand scale of production. Agricultural modernization is required for enhanced resilience of agriculture production and rural livelihoods.

“Not all women have land, and even those who want to rent, find it difficult to get money.” Martha Wamatabu, a Ugandan farmer. 
For many farmers, credit facilities are largely inaccessible. 
There is need to ease access to agricultural finance to all farmers across the country.

### Why is farming necessary for the future
The world's population is growing rapidly, estimated at a 0.8% growth every year. What this means is that the world needs to increase its agricultural output, which means there's going to be a high demand and a great opportunity for an agricultural country like Uganda.

If done right, agricultural earnings can be used to fund the the next wave of economic growth, manufacturing. Of course sectors like energy, manufacturing require massive amounts of investment, in capital, workforce recruitment and training. 
To support that, a well performing and reliable sector is crucial, and what better sector for Uganda than agriculture.

The importance of agriculture in this country cannot be overlooked. Done correctly, it can put Uganda on a highway to economic prosperity.
